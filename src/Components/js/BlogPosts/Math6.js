            <h1>Probabilistic Proofs of the Hook Formula and Young-Frobenius Formula for Young Tableaux and Trees.</h1>
            <h3>In a 1979 paper, Greene, Nijenhuis, and Wilf used a probabilistic method, later termed the hook walk, to prove the hook formula for counting the number of Young tableaux of a certain shape. In 1984, Sagan and Yeh extended this method to prove the hook formula for counting labelings of rooted trees. In this paper, I analyze and re-interpret both proofs to provide an exposition of the probabilistic method in the theory of Young tableaux and trees. I also investigate the related Young-Frobenius formula and its probabilistic proofs — which also use hook walks — in the context of both Young tableaux and Fibonacci trees. My full paper is{' '}
